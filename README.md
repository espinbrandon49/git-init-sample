# git-init-sample

The idea is to delete the . git/ and re-initialize.
go to your cloned repo folder rm -rf .git.

re-initialize it and then add your remote and do your first push. git init git add . git commit -m "your commit message" git remote add origin git push origin master.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
